# Advent of Code

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

Run solutions by passing the year, day and puzzle input like so:
```
$ python aoc <year> <day> [input]
```

If no input is provided, and you have a `.token` file in the root
of the project, the script will attempt to automatically download
your puzzle input from the Advent of Code website. Steps to get
your session token are in the [Puzzle Input Tip](#puzzle-input-tip)
section below.

## Puzzle Input Tip

If you have your Advent of Code session token saved to a file like `.token`, you can download your test input with curl:
```
$ curl "https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1/input" \
       --header "Cookie: $(cat .token)"
```
You can find your session token by looking at the `Cookie` header in the network tab
in your browser tools when navigating to https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1/input.
Save the value of this `Cookie` header in `.token`. e.g.
```
session=XXXX
```
