# AOC2015

Advent of Code 2015 in TypeScript.

This project requires at least the latest LTS release of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

To run the solutions, 
first run `npm install` in the root directory to download the required TypeScript dependencies.
You can then run `npm run aoc -- <day> <input>` to run a particular day's solution on an input file.

For example, to run the day 1 solution:
```bash
$ npm run aoc -- 1 ./input/day01.txt
```
